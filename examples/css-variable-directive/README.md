# Dynamic pass CSS Variable to DOM element

Here are two ways to pass the css variable to DOM element. Beautiful way with the help of directive. But any variable change triggers an Angular —Åhange check. This can critically affect performance. For example, a fast stream of new values for drawing animations. Therefore, I propose a second method of passing css variable. He is ugly, but you better know about him too. You decide which way is best for you.
