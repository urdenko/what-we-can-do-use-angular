# Dynamic pass CSS Variable to DOM element

Here are two ways to pass the css variable to DOM element with the help of directive. The first way is slow, because
every new progress value starts Angular —Åhange check. This can critically affect performance. For example, a fast
stream of new values for drawing animations. Therefore, I propose a second method of passing css variable. He is quick
and clear. You decide which way is best for you.
